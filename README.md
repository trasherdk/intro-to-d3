# Intro to D3

A brief intro to D3.js, with examples - view it online [here][intro-to-d3].

This is a fork of Square's [Intro to D3.js][original-intro-to-d3] tutorial, updated to reflect changes in v5-v7 of D3 (the original tutorial is for v3 and v4).

The major change is that all the data joins in the tutorial and examples have been updated to use the `selection.join()` API instead of the old enter/merge/exit pattern.

Versions of this tutorial compatible with older versions of D3 have been archived in the "releases" section of this repository.
