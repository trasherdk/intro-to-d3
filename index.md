### Introduction

The tutorial provides a quick intro to [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), a Javascript
library for creating data visualizations in the browser. D3 is built on top of
common web standards like HTML, CSS, and SVG.

D3 makes web-based visualizations easier by "automating the hard bits you already
understand," as opposed to "hiding the hard
bits" (hat tip [@andy_matuschak][tweet]).

Again, the tutorial is _not_ a deep dive â€” we want you to learn _how_ to learn
D3 and gain a high-level understanding of this useful tool.

This tutorial is a fork of Square's [Intro to D3](https://square.github.io/intro-to-d3/), updated for newer versions of D3.

### Older Versions

**This tutorial is meant for D3 v5.** Major versions of D3 frequently come with breaking changes, so the code from this tutorial may not run if you are using older versions of D3. 

If you want to view a version of the tutorial compatible with older versions of D3, check out the archived source code here:
- [v3 version][archive-v3]
- [v4 version][archive-v4]
